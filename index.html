  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a web-content manager and editor at the <a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org" target="_blank">American Humanist Association</a>. This is the next sentence of the intro paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is the next paragraph. I will need to come up with language for this space.</p>
  <p>Finally, this will be the last paragraph of the intro section. I should probably end with something witty.</p>

<section class="wherefrom">
  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Medway, Massachusetts - a small town equidistant from Boston and Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
  <p>After graduating from Medway High School in 2003, I attended Syracuse University, where I studied at the <a href="http://newhouse.syr.edu/" target="_blank">Newhouse School of Communications</a>.</p>
  <p>I've lived in Washington, DC since 2007, and I've toyed with the idea of getting a cat since 2009.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h3><em>What are you favorite hobbies?</em></h3>
  <p>When I'm not working, I'm likely out finding a happy hour or home pretending I know how to cook.</p>
  <h3><em>What’s your dream job?</em></h3>
  <p>Ideally, a gummy bear taste-tester. But the non-profit world is good for now.</p>
  <h3><em>What’s your background?</em></h3>
  <p>I'm a northeast snob through-and-through who has been exlied to the mid-Atlantic.</p>
  <h3><em>What music have you been listening to lately?</em></h3>
  <p>Whenever I do work, I listen to <a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Aretha_Franklin/album/Soul_Queen/" target="blank">this 60-song Aretha Franklin compilation album</a>.</p>
